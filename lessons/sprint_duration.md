### Context

Sprint duration of two weeks was found to be too short for the project. Not getting the committed user stories completed within the two week period.

### Consider

It might not be that the duration of the sprint is too short, it could be other things

* your definition of done
* the committed user stories -- maybe too many, too complex
* team dynamics, skill sets

### Solution

Agile is all about inspect and adapt. If, after your team does the retro, the team thinks it is best to adjust the sprint duration, then go try it out. What is important is that once you determined the duration that is just about right, you then keep it consistent. Consistent sprint duration helps with predictability and stakeholder management. It can't just be constantly changing on a whim or because the team is not meeting targets. If the team is not meeting targets, perhaps there's a bigger problem than the sprint duration.
