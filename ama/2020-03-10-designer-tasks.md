### Question

Do designers need to add tasks in Jira for User Stories in the Sprint Backlog? Usually before it goes into the Sprint Backlog, it's already designed?


### Short Answer

Yup, usually before the user stories even goes into the Sprint Backlog, there's been backlog refinement already done by the PO/BA/Designer/Dev/Tester. In theory, as of Sprint Planning, there's enough information in the user story, and for other things pending you know you're likely to be able to get it, for the user story to be completed within the Sprint.

For any design work on the user stories in the Sprint, like maybe an additional icon or image file is needed, or one of the screens that were identified during Sprint Planning, whether they add tasks or not is up to the team. As long as they don't forget about it, it's fine.


### Pahabol

But it also depends on how much analysis your Scrum Master would like to do on sub-task estimates, completion times, etc.  And whether the data collected would actually be used to improve things. So if you foresee that no one's going to have the bandwidth to do more extensive analysis on project metrics, maybe you can stick with what entails the least effort for the Scrum Team. Then *if* it comes up in the retrospective that the team seems to be lagging, maybe *then* you can *consider* adding in some data collection and analysis.

On another note, how then do the backlog refinement work done by the Scrum Team get factored into the team's Velocity?  After all, within the Sprint, they come up with designs, ready user stories, etc.  My guess is indirectly, those backlog refinement work do impact the Sprint's Velocity.  Because if the team spends more time in design work, then they spend less time in completing features and that would pull their velocity down.
