A series of question was posed over at the Guilds under the subject "Wanted: your best practices for working with distributed teams." It seeks out lessons learned and better practices for teams that are distributed (i.e. not physically co-located), especially in the age of 100% remote working. Sharing here the answers I posted for a couple of the questions.

### How to collaborate together when working on a task, when before colleagues might have been sitting side by side in the office?

For a previous Agile project,  we had our daily scrum where we came together, and after which we went back to our respective seating areas so weren't exactly sitting side by side. We made use of our **tools for collaborating asynchronously**. **Jira** was our single source of truth for the user stories and tasks. If there were any clarifications, we'd update Jira with what's been agreed on and we'd notify via the appropriate chat channel. We made use of several channels first in **Slack** and then later on in **MS Teams** so that folks -- devs, UX designer, tester, PO, BA -- can stay tuned into the channel of the app they're working on. When there are clarifications, there may be ones done over DM (direct message) but as much as possible these are done via the corresponding channels. This way when someone has something to share about the app, it won't have to be repeated individually anymore. Apart from channels by app (or modules), there were also channels for the devs, for testing, about deployment or if there's a specific topic that involved a some or the whole team. We also had **Confluence** where we kept the sprint planning and sprint review notes documented there, along with some other documentation about the project. We made use of shared repositories or references, like **GitHub** for the devs, and our UX designers would share the corresponding **Adobe XD** links that the rest of the team can view.

**Adjusting the shift** is also a consideration that was made especially for projects where we had to work with a lot (if not all) of the folks from overseas. This adjustment is so that our working hours have more overlap.

### Any simple working practices that you use to keep the team "on the same page"?

For Agile projects, you have your team's **working agreements** and the rest of the **Agile ceremonies** to help with that. But of course if the team is only going through the motions, then those practices won't be as effective. So there's also a need to build the **discipline** to make use of those practices as actually intended. It'll also help if your Scrum Master or Product Owner is very adamant about keeping the team on the same page.

Simple working practices include **being consistent** about keeping your single source of truth (e.g., Jira) up to date and about making use of the channels to keep folks informed (instead of reverting to 1-on-1 DMs or email).

Idk if it's an unnecessary overhead or what, but I prefer having the **sprint planning sessions documented** capturing (sprint goals, target user stories, aligned leaves, etc) so that in case anyone's attention somehow lapses a bit during the session, the team can refer to it afterwards.

I only answered those I can give some good practices on. Leaving all the questions here as food for thought.

* Has the size of your team impacted the difficulty (or ease) of collaborating when everyone in a separate physical location?
* For teams that use an onshore/offshore mix, what mix of team members do you use to ensure close collaboration with users and (client) stakeholders?  How have the communication modes changed, become better or worse in the age of COVID?
* Any special/new tools that you find especially useful for helping with team collaboration and communication?
