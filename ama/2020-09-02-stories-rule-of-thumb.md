### Question

What are good rules of thumb to consider for finding out how many stories or story points are just about right?


### Googled stuff

THERE'S NO MAGIC NUMBER. But here are some stuff I've googled. Take note that the first sprint is always a learning point so that could be a baseline, and the team will just need to adjust as they go along.

#### 5 to 15 stories per sprint, not more than half the sprint to complete

**5 to 15 stories per sprint** is about right. Four stories in a sprint may be okay on the low end from time to time. Twenty is an upper limit for me if we’re talking about a Web team with lots of small changes to do. Twenty-five may be okay for maintenance teams knocking down a backlog of small defects, but that’s way too many for new development of actual user stories. If you can do that many, your stories are too big, your sprint is too big or your definition of done is too weak.

Most **stories shouldn’t take more than half the sprint to develop and test**. Having 1 story each sprint that takes more than half the sprint is all I would advise, and in that case all the other stories should be very small. For a 2 week sprint, it’s better if every story can be completed in 1 to 3 days. (Adjust that for longer sprints.)

#### 15 stories

I recommend stories of size two days per pair. So a 6ix person team would have three pairs, and in two weeks would have ten pair days, and therefore take on about five stories per pair, or fifteen stories.

#### A couple of days to build and test

A good rule of thumb is to break down stories to something that takes a couple of days to build and test.

### From one previous project

Some actual data I managed to keep from one project (about 2 teams, 1 sprint = 4 weeks) is summarized below.

| | Average | For 1 team for 2 weeks (just divided by 4) |
|-|-|-|
| Stories per sprint          |  33.58 |  8.40 |
| Bugs per sprint (not sized) |  32.17 |  8.04 |
| Story points per sprint     | 123.83 | 30.96 |
| Bugs per story              |   1.08 | n/a   |
| Bugs per story point        |   0.28 | n/a   |
