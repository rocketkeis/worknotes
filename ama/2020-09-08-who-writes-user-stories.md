### Question

Who writes the user stories? It's the PO (Product Owner), right?


### Short Answer

Anyone in the Scrum team.


### Longer Answer

From experience, it's not necessarily the PO who writes the user stories. In a past project, we had a BA (Business Analyst) work with the PO to capture the user story details. As a tester, I've also experienced helping flesh out the user stories particularly the acceptance criteria. As a PO, I've written user stories on my own, but I had to switch views as BA/SA/Designer/Tester; and of course, the team's inputs get factored in during Sprint Planning or ad hoc clarification sessions. As a PO, I've also collaborated closely with the Tech Lead/Dev, UX Designer and Tester to write the user stories. I've also heard of instances wherein the Dev writes the user stories.

In any case, writing the user story is collaborative and takes into account the perspectives of the [_three amigos_](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/three-amigos):

* Business – What problem are we trying to solve?
* Development – How might we build a solution to solve that problem?
* Testing – What about this, what could possibly happen?

Here's what the [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) has to say about the PO's work of managing the backlog (which includes writing the user stories):

> The Product Owner may do the above work, or have the Development Team do it. However, the Product Owner remains accountable.

Googling for "who writes user stories", one of the [first results](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories) states:

> Anyone can write user stories. It's the product owner's responsibility to make sure a product backlog of agile user stories exists, but that doesn't mean that the product owner is the one who writes them. Over the course of a good agile project, you should expect to have user story examples written by each team member.
