### Question

For tasks that are purely development/setup work, do designers, testers also have to join the estimation for that story?


### Short answer

From experience, those who are involved in the user story are the ones who need to size it. Not sure if there's a standard for this, but personally, it's ok for me for them not to size.


### Pahabol

Buuuut.... sizing is done during Sprint Planning, wherein I expect **_everyone_** to be there -- not just the devs. So if it's the start of the project, I'd recommend that they also look into what needs to be set up to help facilitate testing and design work, and collaborative work with the rest of the team.
