### Question

What if the team still has the capacity to do advanced work on backlog items in the current sprint, but they can't commit that they can complete those user stories?

### Short Answer

Recognize the team for working efficiently with the current sprint's user stories, and for having the initiative to take on advance work.

In terms of backlog management, there are many ways to go about with it. What's important is that expectations are aligned that if they can start it, that's well and good since they're advance work after all. If they can't finish it, it won't be taken against them because it wasn't part of the committed user stories after all.

1. Create the next sprint backlog and then put the user stories that they want to work on in advance, which they can complete in the next sprint.

2. Add the additional user stories into the current sprint backlog. Just tag accordingly or don't take it against the team if those added ones are not done.  Then cover them in the next sprint planning to be added into the next sprint backlog.

3. Have the advance work user stories at the top of the product backlog. And same as previous, tag accordingly. And cover them in the next sprint planning.

Additional controls (through branching) might be needed if the team is close to shipping something to production -- you wouldn't want to have unfinished, untested work shipped out.
