### Question

Should learning curve be considered during story point estimation?


### Short Answer

Yeah, it's a legitimate factor that would affect how fast or slow a story can be done.


### Pahabol

An option is to break off a user story/chore for picking up stuff / onboarding self, and then size that.

But it's fine to just leave it as it is. Part of an Agile Scrum team's growth includes not just learning more about the domain, but also getting better in sizing their stories.

(Watch-out: oversimplified example coming up) Let's say in an earlier sprint, they say that it'll take 8 points to implement a particular feature, and they used up the entire sprint for that 1 feature.  In theory, the team's familiarity with their work and with each other improves making for work to flow more smoothly or faster (in theory!). So later down the line, they could size a similar feature only a 3 or 5, and they can manage completing 3 of those in a sprint. So from initially having 8 points-1 feature to 9 points-3 features, that doesn't seem so bad. And that seems realistic and fair to expect that they won't be churning out as many features at the start.

It's also possible that there are members of the Scrum team who are at different levels of familiarity/experience. So guidance from the more senior folks would also help ground estimates by the more junior folks. And that's also the key in sizing stories, that if there's a huge enough discrepancy, the team talks about it to understand where it is coming from.
