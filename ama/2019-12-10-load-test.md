### Question

Any suggested tool or reading materials that is best to use to simulate case of at least 6000 visits?


### Short Answer

Tools used in previous projects

* HP Load Runner (now MicroFocus Load Runner) - not free
* [Gatling](https://gatling.io/)


### Pahabol

My background on this is rather limited. No firsthand experience in scripting and execution. Only in helping in the analysis of the results.

I think one advantage of Load Runner over Gattling is that we can specify a steady state in the former. Variables we played around with back then included:

* Ramp-up rate e.g., 4 users / 15 seconds, or 200 users / 1 min
* Steady state e.g., 15 minutes, none for Gatling
* Number of users e.g., 50, 100, 200, 500
