### Question

Which needs to be handled first? Bugs with low priority but high impact, or those with high priority with low impact?


### Short Answer

Some bug trackers might not have separate fields for priority and severity. In this case wherein they do, I'd assume that priority would indicate just that.

However, if your gut is telling you that something marked as low priority (high impact) has to be escalated to a higher priority, then you need to be prepared in communicating why or how so.
