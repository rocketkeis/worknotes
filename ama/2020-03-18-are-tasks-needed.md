### Question

I've gotten a couple of questions on whether the designers or testers need to add tasks under their corresponding user story for their respective work within the Sprint?


### Short answer

It depends. _It always depends._

I think what's important is that things get done, and that there's transparency that work is being done. The transparency could be through workflow changes (e.g., status goes from "for testing" to "testing" and so on), or when you see tasks moving across the board (e.g., from "to do" to "in progress" and so on) or during the team's Daily Scrum.


### Pahabol

The tool is also a factor. Because if it's making the creation, maintenance and monitoring of tasks too cumbersome, then the team should either live with it OR suggest solutions that would work better for them.

I'd also like to add that it's not the responsibility of the Scrum Master to always be checking up on whether folks are doing their tasks. That's a step back from being self-managing teams.

I guess if I were to start a project and have a say on whether the team adds tasks or not, I'd go with asking everyone to put in tasks and then see how it goes. We can cover it in the retro, or if it's becoming an impediment it could (and should) be raised in the Daily Scrum.
