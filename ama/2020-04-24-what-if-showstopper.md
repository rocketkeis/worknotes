### Question

What if there's a show stopping bug, and the stakeholders are pushing for the release today? Do we object or will we still proceed with the release?


### Short Answer

I think the work of testers is to provide the information, in this case, there's this showstopper of a bug. Maybe there's just a need to share information on how critical the bug is, how likely it is, or what would be the impact of releasing this out in the wild.

The rest of the team can also pitch in, because it's possible that as critical as it is, the fix might be very quick, simple, and low-risk of breaking any other stuff.

Ultimately, the decision to release is not the testers' call.
